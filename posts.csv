, Check to see if there is a known usegalaxy.* server issue., If the server was down when you first ran your job, try a rerun once back up. A rerun can also eliminate transient server issues too short in duration to trigger a statuspage warning., Next, start by reviewing the troubleshooting FAQ. Common reasons and solutions for tool errors are explained. Most job errors can be resolved by correcting your input data’s format/content. Others indicate a tool setting/parameter problem. This summary FAQ links to most other support FAQs., If you cannot determine how to fix a data/input problem, search existing Q&A topics, support FAQs, and other Galaxy resources. Someone else may have had the same problem with a posted solution. Many tools will have ongoing usage discussions. The most common data/usage issues have a dedicated FAQ., If you are unsure about how to correct a tool usage problem, review the tool help and prior Q&A., If that is not enough tool usage information to solve your problem, try comparing your analysis methods with those in our tutorials:, If you think you found a software bug, review the issue FAQ and linked known issues to find out if it has already been reported and to learn how to report a new problem:, If you need help after troubleshooting on your own, or would like a suspected bug vetted, please let us know by creating a new post to this site. The more details you include, the more help we can offer. For example: include the exact tool name/version (found at the top of the tool form), input data type/source, error details, screenshots., Thanks!

, Hi Galaxy team,, I need to include new variable modifications which are absent in the list. Is it possible to add these modifications to Galaxy? Like in the MaxQuant configuration tab?, With best regards,, Arman, Hi @Arman_Kulyyassov,
do you mean to modify some tools in order to include additional options?, Regards, Thank you very much for your reply.
I downloaded MaxQuant (version  1.6.6.0)  to my desktop computer and included two new variable modifications Glyceroyl-Lys (composition H(4) O C(3)) and PhosphoGlyceroyl-Lys (composition H(5) O(6) C(3) P) on the configuration tab. Do you have the same options to include new protein modifications on MaxQuant in Galaxy?
, , Yes,
in that case, you need to open a Pull Request in order to include those modifications in this file tools-galaxyp/macros.xml at master · galaxyproteomics/tools-galaxyp · GitHub 1.

Another member of my group has analysed this data with a non-galaxy approach and was able to get genus-level information., My results have been very low resolution in comparison. I have tried Kraken2 with different databases as reference, but would love some help or ideas as to how I could improve my results, ideally to as many genus classifications as possible, or family. Anything would be helpful!!!, Hi @Lid,

, Hello everybody,, I am very new to Galaxy and hope for help with a - most likely - very trivial problem. I am trying to run the Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip module according to the respective Tutorial but using my own data. Unfortunately, I now encountered the error:, “(…)
Error in read.metharray(list.files(pattern = “_Red.idat”)) :
[read.metharray] Trying to parse IDAT files with different array size but seemingly all of the same type.
You can force this by ‘force=TRUE’, see the man page ?read.metharray
Execution halted”, According to what I found in the Bioconductor forum, this seems to happen quite regularly with EPIC data and it should be okay to try the ‘force=TRUE’. But, unfortunately, I do not know how to adjust this setting using Galaxy., Any advice would be very welcome!, Many thanks in advance and best wishes,
Lea, Hi @ljflitsch,
I opened a PR 2 in order to include this option in the Galaxy wrapper., Regards, Hey,
@gallardoalba: Thank you very much for your help and effort. Since I am really new to this topic: Is there any way to get notified once this option becomes actually usable in Galaxy as an ‘end user’? E.g. anything/anywhere I can ‘follow’ to receive updates on this matter (perhaps via registering at GitHub)? Sorry for any inconveniences and best regards!, Yes, if you leave a comment in the PR, it will notify the news related to it., Regards, Will do so. Thank you very much., Are there perhaps any news on this topic? It has been a while since this help request and the corresponding PR has been initiated. Unfortunately though, I’m still encountering the same error message I’ve also had back then. Thus, I am now wondering whether the error might originally have had a different source or whether the ‘force=TRUE’ option was not yet included in the Galaxy wrapper (at least I could not spot a new setting bar for this). Many thanks!, Hi @ljflitsch,
sorry, I didn’t get any response from the tool developers; I tried again to ask them to review the Pull Request. If in the next few days there’re no news, I’ll try to find a different solution., Regards]"

, Hello. I would like to ask there I can find some information how to interpret BedCov tool output, because there is just numbers in the first line (header) and I can’t understand which column shows me sequence coverage? The second question is how I can visualize the coverage using Galaxy? Is there any tool which might help to do that?, Hi, did you find out what the bedcov output meant?, Hi @amyhouseman,
bedcov reports the total number of reads in the specific interval (sum of per-base read depths per BED region, discussed here). What is your goal? If you are interested in computing the average coverage of specific intervals, I suggest you to use bedtools Genome Coverage., Regards, Hi! Thank you for your reply., I wanted to work out the average read depth at each position using the bam file against the capture exome bed file - I did this using the average of the samtools depth output., Then I want to see how much coverage and % mapping has been achieved over the capture exome bed file - for this I have just been using samtools flagstat (samtools view -bu -L capture.bed in.bam |samtools flagstat)., I think the output of this gives me what I need for the % mapped to the bed?:, 91223463 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)
0 + 0 secondary
11162 + 0 supplementary
0 + 0 duplicates
91220169 + 0 mapped (100.00% : N/A)
91212301 + 0 paired in sequencing
45644366 + 0 read1
45567935 + 0 read2
90959524 + 0 properly paired (99.72% : N/A)
91204491 + 0 with itself and mate mapped
4516 + 0 singletons (0.00% : N/A)
154458 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr
143066 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5), I have ran bedcov but I don’t know if its output is relevant for the coverage mapping percentage. I did try and use bedtools genome coverage but couldn’t work out how to use my bed file as the comparison - if that makes sense!, Thanks,
Amy, Indeed bedcov is not relevant at all in that case; regarding bedtools genome coverage, you could use bedtools Intersect intervals in order to get the reads that overlap with the exome capture bed file, and then using it as input for the bedtools genome coverage tool., Regards]"

, Dear support team at GALAXY,, I have recently performed a ChIP-seq experiment consisting of:
2x WT (neg. ctrls: a strain that has no GFP tagged proteins but was subjected to the IP with the anti-GFP)
2x TF1-GFP (IP with the anti-GFP)
2x TF2-GFP (IP with the anti-GFP)
3x TF3-GFP(IP with the anti-GFP), Some necessary details:
-The ChIP was performed simultaneously with all 9x samples
-All TFs were previously checked in the confocal, in the same dev. stage that I later performed the fixation of my ChIP, and they showed clear nuclear signals.
-The background of all TF strains is the same Wt that I have used as neg. Ctrl, After the seq, I got 2x files with reads for each sample. Thus, I had to uncompress and then combine them with the “Concatenate datasets” tool and then proceed to the mapping with Bowtie2. I did the same of course with all 3x TFs and I got for all very good % of uniquely mapped reads avg. 85% out of ca. 50 mio reads/sample., I have then tried to identify statistically significant peaks for TFs with MACS2. The analysis of TF1 and TF2 did work great. With the analysis of TF3 I have a problem, or at least I cannot rule out at the current stage, if I have a rather technical problem with my analysis, that I should solve, or if simply the TF3 at the point of sampling has no binding to DNA whatsoever however is nuclear-localized., When I am running MACS2 for peak identification of TF3 I am getting the message in the Image_1 (see attachments).
, , Please note that I am getting the same message no matter which combinations of Wt and TF3 samples I choose. I am getting the same output even when I am playing with different settings of the MACS2 (e.g make a model or make no model etc). What is weird to me is the fact that I get -0- peaks from any combination of samples; although, the tool gives from the other hand no error. Please see how the corresponding mappings look like in IGB in the Image_2 (see attachments)., , , The above is already a very not normal appearance of all 3x TF3s., On the other hand, when I am using the same 2x Wt for the analysis of the TF1 & 2, where I got stat. sign. Peaks. Please see in the Image_3 (see attachments) how this mapping looks, , , This looks very normal, from my experience., I am also thinking that If we would assume that the TF3 had no real binding positions then I should be getting, more less the same appearance of the distribution of the peaks over the chromosome as the Wts; but this is not the case. From the other side, all 3x biol. repl. of the TF3 look the same. The same ab did work nicely for the other two TFs. And the pipeline of my analysis with GALAXY works also nicely for the other 2x TFs. My personal feeling is that I do (or do not) something during the analysis of the TF3, thus I do get no peaks… Bottom line is that I would like to know, if I have a technical issue with my analysis or if simply the TF3 does not bind anywhere at this dev. stage., Could you please help me?, I would highly appreciate any help?

Is it posible to do a Multiqc after htseq?

I have done Multiqc using featureCounts, but not what the input should be when i use the htseq data, Thanks,G, , Hi @GGOPA
yes, MultiQC can visualize summary files from htseq-count. % of alignments can be calculated from numbers in summary files. Note that htseq-count summaries describe alignments, not reads, eg a read mapped to two  locations has two alignments.
Hope this answers the question.
Kind regards,
Igor, Thanks, Igor., I get 2 output files for htseq.  One that shows the counts (Gene ID and number of aligned reads) and another that says (no feature) with details of ‘ambiguous, low_aQual, non-aligned and not-unique aligned’ as shown in my previous post. I do not see a file called ‘Summary’ as the one that is generated by featureCounts. And Multiqc could not be executed by with these two files.
Many thanks,
GG, Hi @GGOPA
I am sorry for clumsy explanation. Summary file is one with (no feature) at the end. It contain summary for alignment counting. During setup of MultiQC job select HTSeq for Which tool was used generate logs?. Select only summary files with (no feature). Do not use count files.
Hope it helps.

For HISAT2, it aks to specify strand information (Unstranded/FR/RF) and then, Q2. also asks to choose*‘Select the upstream/downstream mate orientations for a valid paired-end alignment against the forward reference strand*’ with options (–fr/–rf/–ff)., Q3. for htseq it asks to choose setting for ‘stranded’ with options (yes/no/reverse)., I used FR and --fr for HISAT2 and obtained 43% overall mapping. Then I used those BAM files to perfomr htseq and selected YES for the ‘stranded’ option. After doing MultiQC, I see 0% reads were assigned., Many thanks,G, Hi @GGOPA
read strandness is determined by protocol used for preparation of library. Ideally, your sequencing service provider should give it to you as part of description for sequencing data. HiSAT2 and htseq-count settings are determined by the data. If you don’t have information on strandness of your reads, either ask your sequencing provider or determine it as described in Strandness section of this tutorial: 1: RNA-Seq reads to counts
Good description of strandness is available in another tutorial: De novo transcriptome reconstruction with RNA-Seq

Is this at the DropletUtil step? Could you please advise?, Hi Carolyn,
Yes, most likely you lost the gene symbols in DropletUtils. The gene information file (RNA STARSolo on bla bla: Genes raw) produced by STARSolo contains gene id in the 1st column and gene symbol in the 2nd column. So the DopletUtils takes the gene ids instead of gene symbols to construct its output matrix. You can cut c2 from “RNA STARSolo on bla bla: Genes raw” file and then use it for DropletUtils. But the problem is that the gene symbols are not always unique. We have to make them unique before inputting to DropletUtils. It is possible to make the names unique using some AWK program. But it can also be solved using anndata tools. A possible solution is the following:, Yes, most likely you lost the gene symbols in DropletUtils., Hmm, pretty interesting. Anyway, thanks @pavanvidem for providing the solution.]"

I tried using RNASTAR and the resut was similar., I wanted to know if all the unmapped reads belong to the viral genes, if it is not from the host.Therefore, I chose the option to write the unaligned reads separately while re-running HISAT2. I got 2 files’HISAT2 on data:unalined reads (L)’  and ‘HISAT2 on data:unlined reads (R)’., Q1. What is L and R here? Do they denote pairs, as my library was paired-ends? If so, which one should I choose as my Forward read and Reverse read when I do the mapping?, Q2. Can you please suggest an appropriate method to see what proportion of these unmapped reads belonged to the virus?, Many thanks,G]"

, Hi,
I have paired-end stranded libraries.Can someone please let me know what should I choose for these 3 options to run HISAT2 and htseq thereafter, given that my inferexperiment result is1±,1-+,2++,2–, Q1. For HISAT2, it aks to specify strand information (Unstranded/FR/RF) and then, Q2. also asks to choose*‘Select the upstream/downstream mate orientations for a valid paired-end alignment against the forward reference strand*’ with options (–fr/–rf/–ff)., Q3. for htseq it asks to choose setting for ‘stranded’ with options (yes/no/reverse)., I used FR and --fr for HISAT2 and obtained 43% overall mapping. Then I used those BAM files to perfomr htseq and selected YES for the ‘stranded’ option. After doing MultiQC, I see 0% reads were assigned., Many thanks,G]"

, Hello all,, I was wondering if there are any plans to update diffbind on galaxy.org? The current version is 3.6.1 but galaxy is currently running 2.10.0, Thanks, Hi @stealsh, The version at the top of the tool form in Galaxy is the wrapper around the 3rd party tool. If you run a tool in Galaxy, the version of the different components (requirements) actually used for the job are included in the Job Logs 1. Those requirements are also included in the Toolshed., For this tool, most seems to be current between the Diffbind Bioconductor version and the Galaxy version in the ToolShed, and as hosted for use at the public servers UseGalaxy.org, UseGalaxy.eu, and UseGalaxy.org.au., Bioconductor: “Bioconductor version: Release (3.15)”, Galaxy ToolShed: Galaxy | Tool Shed, Requirements:, You mentioned version “3.6.1” – and that is Bioconductor version for their package when installed locally. Galaxy uses portions of that in the wrapper, and incorporates other parts directly., The current version is 3.6.1 but galaxy is currently running 2.10.0, Is there a specific sub-function when using Diffbind that you are looking for? It may not have been included in the current Galaxy wrapper that you see represented on the tool page. Or, maybe we can help you to find it , Hi @jennaj,, Thanks for the detailed reply. I appreciate all the hard work you all do to make galaxy such a great resource!, There seems to be many functions in diffbind (as per the vignette) that are not available in galaxy., For example, it is possible to output Venn diagrams in diffbind to show overlap, and lack of, between samples; this is not present in galaxy. Also, profile plots are not available in galaxy. Further, different normalisation methods are available in diffbind, such as sequencing depth or spike-in DNA. These aren’t available in galaxy, but I would like to be able to use both methods, though I assume sequencing depth is default in galaxy., Also, this may be a separate question that I need to start a new thread for, but is it possible to download the data from biffbind separated out into different groups? What I mean by this is that I have data from two transcriptions factors, TF1 & TF2. Both bind at the same sites throughout the genome, but diffbind shows that in some loci only TF1 binds and in other loci only TF2 binds. What I’d like to do is download the coordinates for where TF1 only binds, where TF2 only binds, and where TF1&TF2 bind together as separate groups so I can do motif analysis. Is this possible with diffbind or do I need to find another way?, Regards,
Steve, Hi @stealsh, Scroll down in the tool form and expand the section “Output Options”. I think that most of of the extra outputs you are looking for are included., Plus you can output a copy of all the Rdata tables and the Rscript used during the processing in Galaxy if you want to parse the results in custom ways, or using methods in the Bioconductor vignette directly., Meaning, the Rscript and Rdata tables can be used with R directly inside of Galaxy (inside interactive environments), or downloaded to use wherever you prefer to use R. Find Galaxy Interactive Environments (GIEs) in the tool panel under the section Interactive Environments. The UseGalaxy.eu server hosts the largest variety of GIEs., One example is Rstudio and the GTN has tutorials that cover basics (moving data from a history into an environment, then back out into a history), others are used in scientific tutorials, and some cover coding languages themselves., The basic get data in/out methods are mostly the same between the different GIEs – the tool form that launches the environment will have the function details. And some of the GIEs combine multiple programming environments (R, python, bash). The Interactive Jupyter Notebook one example, and also has a GTN tutorial., GTN Tutorials can be searched with keywords or navigated directly., Example GTN searches:, “rstudio”  == Search Tutorials
“interactive-tools” == Search Tutorials
“jupyter” == Search Tutorials, Example topic navigation:, These are coding topics that could be applied when using IEs in Galaxy, or other places. R is included. News post explaining the goals: New Topic: Data Science Survival Kit 1, https://training.galaxyproject.org/ >> “Data Science Survival Kit” >> Galaxy Training!, Small warning: GIEs do not automatically track or save work into a Galaxy history the same as regular tools. That means you need to specifically track the tools or functions or datasets within the environment. If you quit out of the session, the content is lost. If the server has a hiccup, the content is lost. So be sure to save your important analysis artifacts back into the history – periodically while working then once done. That can include the entire environment plus scripts and files (all will show up as “datasets” in the history)., GIEs can be left active themselves and relaunched for short time periods (find any still active in your account under User > Active InteractiveTools, but none are quite perfect. You might need to kill a prior GIE to start a new one: do this by purging the history dataset that represents it. And, definitely save back anything you would miss to the history the environment was launched from. I know I said “save” twice already … but learning the hard way isn’t so fun  and everyone is very used to Galaxy automatically capturing and saving all work by default. GIEs are different., Hope that helps more! If you find a specific function that you can’t do – or that seems to be something so commonly included that it would be helpful to add more options into the tool form GUI directly, please write back and we can make a request to the developers. They can determine what is possible or practical., Hi @jennaj,
Thanks for the detailed reply., I’ll look into using R to help me unlock some of these other functions/outputs., Regards,
Steve]"

, I am currently doing my project work on Exome sequencing and is using the following tutorial (Exome sequencing data analysis for diagnosing a genetic disease). I have an error in GEMINI load tool. It is showing that the VCF format is unavailable(SNPEff eff). Please look into the problem and help me with it. Thank you
, , Hi @Thara_Dharanidhar
not quite sure what we are seeing in those screenshots.
Apparently, you’ve run the tool already and have produced a gemini.sqlite dataset with it?
Anyway, the reason why the Vcf dataset is not offered in the select box is likely that you haven’t set a format/dbkey on it. Click on the pencil icon on your dataset and set the dbkey to hg19., Hi @wm75
I did exactly what you told but i am not getting the output. I set the dbkey as hg19 but no result.Can u suggest alternative tool instead of GEMINI load.
, , I’m sorry, but I don’t understand what the issue is. You have obtained a GEMINI load dataset and its state is green. Everything looks good and you can just continue with the tutorial, can’t you?, Hi@wm75
GEMINI load tool is working and its state is also green but I am unable to view the output as some file is getting downloaded every time I click the view option. What kind of data will be obtained from GEMINI load tool as you can see my screenshot showing that (loading chunk 1 , loading chunk 2…) So the data will look like this or in some other format. Please help me out.
, , This file is getting downloaded whenever I click the view data . When I click the file this message appears “file cannot be viewed”.
, , Yes, the GEMINI load tool produces a GEMINI database, which is not intended to be viewed, but queried. Please follow the tutorial, which explains a few ways how you can do that.
These tutorials: Identification of somatic and germline variants from tumor and normal sample pairs 1 and Calling variants in diploid systems demonstrate more options.
Think of the GEMINI database as a computer-friendly version of a VCF. You can’t read it, but queries are very efficient. The GEMINI load tool is essentially the converter that takes VCF and produces the database format., Hi@wm75
Thank you so much for your help.]"

, Hi, I’m converting a number of sequences from FASTQ to FASTA, and previously the output has named files the same as the input, but now it’s calling them FASTQ to FASTA on data 20, so I don’t know which sample it is.
How do I change this so it keeps my unique IDs?
Thanks!, You can change file names manually: Edit Attributes (pencil icon) > Change name > click Save.
You can create a collection of FASTQ files and convert fastq into fasta on collection. Collections keep the original names, but more complicated to work with
You can create a small Galaxy workflow and rename output dataset using basename, so you can remove suffix corresponding to FASTQ file and add something like .fa. Search for a tutorial on Galaxy workflow for more information.
You can add tags to FASTQ files. Tags will propagate through analysis.
Hope this helps.
Kind regards,

And do you already have a FASTQ file? Is it possible that your single fastq dataset is representing a paired-end run? If that is the case you can look at the tool named FASTQ splitter., Maybe this page can also help:, Collection of tutorials developed and maintained by the w..., , , Because it is just a tutorial and if you process all accessions it would take a while.

[W::bam_hdr_read] EOF marker is absent. The input is probably truncated, Also, the size of the bam file is extremely small, only 52kb, Hi @wcq848677, The BAM is downsampled so it will run quickly when running through the tutorial., This is a history that has that particular BAM loaded (size is 51.2 KB), and the content is as expected. I also converted Bam-to-Sam in that history, and that worked plus produced the right result. Galaxy | Accessible History | tutorial variants. When you run Freebayes, input the BAM, no need to convert to SAM. If you want to see the content of the BAM, it is small enough that Galaxy can produce the uncompressed “SAM” view (use the “eye” icon for the dataset)., Maybe you got a corrupted version? Try pasting just this link into the Upload tool in Galaxy. Leave all the other settings at default. https://zenodo.org/record/60520/files/GIAB-Ashkenazim-Trio-hg19.gz, You can also make a copy of that history to work with it.

, Hello. I am using cuffdiff in the galaxy. Between my cuffdiff output, there are no isoforms differential expression file and I get 17 files in my output instead of 23. how can I get isoforms differential expression file?
please guide me.
thank you., Hi @Sevda.Hosseinzadeh, Updated transcriptomic analysis methods are strongly recommended, and many tools for transcriptomics analysis are covered in the Galaxy tutorials here: Galaxy Training!. You can also review the RNA-seq or RNA Analysis tool groups., If you get stuck with a non-deprecated tool, review this troubleshooting FAQ first, then ask questions here with the context from your troubleshooting and a shared history., Between my cuffdiff output, there are no isoforms differential expression file and I get 17 files in my output instead of 23, Cuffdiff and many other of the “Cuff” tools are deprecated on most public Galaxy servers. Check to see if this, or any of the tools that you may have used upstream, is marked deprecated where you are working. Deprecated tools may directly fail, or they might just produce odd results., Even if the “Cuff” tool is not marked as deprecated on a particular server, it may still produce odd results or have limited/modified results for technical reasons. These tools won’t be updated. That said, common problems that people used to run into usually involved the reference annotation. Upstream from that, the BAM sometimes had problems. Both were usually about missing attributes or format issues., This link points to a search of our prior forum with the keywords “biostars cuffdiff”. That may not fix the problem you are having (missing expected outputs), but if you really want to use the old tool, checking the usage/inputs for prior known issues is where to start., To do your own search, go to the  Pan-Galactic Google Search and add in the search term (names other “Cuff” tools used upstream? or the mapping tool?) along with the keyword “biostars” to limit the results. This forum doesn’t include that original discussion since it started being used a few years after those tools were deprecated., Thank you very much.]"
